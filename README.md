Introduction to using SQL and DB mapping

This project was the culmination of an introduction to using SQL. In addition, we were required to map out our database.

Mapping the database and considering what were Primar and Foreign keys was the biggest challenge, though as the project
progressed it made more and more logical sense. I feel very comfortable making advanced SQL queries, and look forward
to learning even more advanced techniques.

Next Steps:
- Learn to do some more advanced looping in my queries. This is a big challenge based on the dataset. A smaller dataset
and incorrect looping means a slowdown. Larger datasets leads to crashes and other major issues.
